# DAA-Project
This is a Repo to maintain the data of DAA Group Project

Aim: “Anomaly detection in time-series data using longest common subsequence.”

Problem Statement: The aim of this project is to develop an eﬀective anomaly detection system for time-series data leveraging the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Time-series data, characterized by sequential observations over time, poses unique challenges in identifying anomalies or irregular patterns that deviate from the expected behaviour. The LCS algorithm, known for its ability to find common patterns in sequences, will be employed to detect anomalies by comparing the similarity between subsequences within the time-series data. The project will address the need for efficient algorithms capable of handling large-scale time-series datasets while providing interpretable results to facilitate actionable insights for end-user
